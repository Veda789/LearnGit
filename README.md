Learning how git works
- Get the git url of the repository you want to get into your local system. For example, the git url of the current repository is https://github.com/Veda789/LearnGit.git
- Open GitBash and use the command 'git clone https://github.com/Veda789/LearnGit.git' to clone the required repository.
- Check the files using 'ls' command which lists out the files under current folder.
- 'git status' command is used to know the status of the file. The status can be modified, staged or commited.
- 'git log' is used to get logging information.
